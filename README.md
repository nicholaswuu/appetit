# Appetit

This project is deployed [here](https://appetit-d10d8fac3d83.herokuapp.com/)

Appetit is an app built for you to rate and keep track of your various restaurant visits. The idea behind this app was inspired by me and my girlfriend's love for eating new foods and trying new cuisines â€” as we kept trying new restaurants, we decided to start a Notion list with all of our visits and rating each one. This app was designed to be a better looking version of this list.

## Features

This is a full-stack application built using React and Node.js, and deployed using Heroku. It includes React components for the search bar, user profile, and editable restaurants table. The app uses Firebase for user authentication and Google log-in/log-out functionality. The app is integrated with a MongoDB database to store each Google users visits, so that they are still there every visit. The search bar uses the Google Maps API for its autocomplete feature, making it easier for users to search for restaurants. I spent about 15 hours for this project over 4 days.
